#how do you d eclare variables inpython ?
# In python, You just write the varibale on the left,followed by assignment operator, and the value  you want to assign the variable on the right.

#Example ::
name = "John Doe"  # string variable
age = 20 # integer variable
height = 5.9  # float variable

#when naming variables in python, you should follow these rules:
# 1: Varibale name can only start with a letter or an undescore_ but not a number.
# 2: Variable name can oly contain Number alphabet and underscores
# 3: Variable names are case sensetive.
# 4: Python's reserved keywords cannont be use as a variable name. example : print, if, class, def
# 5: You should use descriptive names for variables. 
# Example:
user_age = 25
user_name = "Arun Baral"
